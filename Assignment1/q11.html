        Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a style sheet language 
        used for describing the presentation of web pages, including 
        colors, layout, and fonts. It allows developers to separate the content (HTML) 
        from the presentation, making websites more maintainable and easier to update. 
        With CSS, you can apply styles globally to an entire site or locally to specific 
        elements. It supports a wide range of features like animations, transitions, and 
        responsive design, which are essential for creating visually appealing and 
        functional web pages.
