      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the
      standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the
      structure for a webpage by using elements like headings, paragraphs,
      links, images, and more.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key features of HTML is its ability to
      organize content semantically. By using tags developers can create web
      pages that are both visually structured and accessible to users and search
      engines.
